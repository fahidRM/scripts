# scripts

An archive of unrelated scripts used to handle little tasks.
(Shell scripts, Logstash Conf files)

**- launch_opernfire.sh**

  Written to help launch openfire server when the Application tray fails (mac).
  
  
**- mysql_dump.sh**

  Dumps specified database on the Desktop. For when I don't want to access phpmyadmin. 
  
**- logstash/**

  A collection of logstash scripts (quite generic but representative of some tasks I have done with logstash without containing the data structure, source and destination information). Serves as a template for future work with logstash.
